            </h1>

            <p>

            Thanks for browsing my portfolio! Hello and welcome to my website!! This website is a personal project that I'm undertaking to both start building up a portfolio and to learn some web development skills. I'm doing so with the help of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/" target = "_blank"  rel = "noopener">The Odin Project</a>, an open-source resource that teaches beginners some rudimentary skills, with the intention of giving some exposure to full-stack web development.</p><br>
            
            <p class="generic-fade"> In regards to languages, the Odin Project covers the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then follows into either RoR or .node frameworks (I haven't quite decided which of these I'll adopt just yet, but I'll think about it when I get there!!). </p>

            <br><p>
            As it stands, I'm still setting up the main display features on the client-side, so there isn't much up and running now except for the 'Film Photography' page - but I'm working on it, and and will have the others up very soon.

        I intend to use this website for a couple things, but mostly as a form of archival where I can rest easy knowing that I don't have to rely on any third-party paid services (I am currently VERY broke, and therefore cannot justify paying for a third-party hosting service). I'm currently hosting this via GitHub Pages, which you can view <a href = "https://github.com/skw43/portfolio-blog" target = "_blank"  rel = "noopener">here</a>. This repository also includes all of the source code to this project if you would like to have a look.

        What I'm Working on Now
    </h2>
    <p class="generic-fade">I'm currently working on <a href = "./pages/flexbox-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page right here (Film Photography)</a>, trying to practice with the FlexBox format whilst getting familiar with CSS. For the best experience, I recommend viewing it on a newish version of Chrome Desktop as it uses the <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animate-timeline</a> function on CSS (Scroll-based animations), which hasn't been universally adopted just yet. (I've put in some older animations too in case your browser doesn't support this, but honestly? they're not as fun).</p>
