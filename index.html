                        Biomechanical loading of the musculoskeletal system during exercise
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For my Master's dissertation, I used biomechanical simulations to examine how different exercise movements exerted loads on the human skeleton. Specifially, I focused on calculating loads in the hip, knee, and ankle joints, as lower limb and hip fractures are associated with the highest mortality rates in osteoporotic patients.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My research consisted of three distinct phases. The first phase including preparing large datasets of motion-capture data for simulation (100K+ readings per dataset), using JavaScript and MATLAB scripting to automate the process. I then used this data to create and scale musculoskeletal models within OpenSim (biomechanical simulation software), and run simulations for various participants and exercise movements. Finally, I used MATLAB to assist in data post-processing, assessing simulation results and performance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my primary results, a key deliverable in my research (and the one that I am most proud of) was a novel statistical framework that I adapted from sociology. I developed this framework to address the literature gap in quantifying simulation performance, and used it as a means of validation, and for automating outlier detection.

                                The Group Business and Design Project (GBDP) is a semester-long group project, equivalent in scope to a BEng dissertation. Working in a group of five engineering students from different disciplines, each group develops a technical design to meet the client specifications of an industry sponsor.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                Technical Role: Chassis Design of a Concrete Pump
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                My group was tasked with producing a concrete pump suitable for small-scale, off-terrain construction sites. Current solutions either exceed the needs for a small site, and consequently require premium hiring costs. Conversely, smaller-scale solutions (i.e. mixing concrete on-site) do not satisfy industry standards for building concrete foundations.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I was responsible for designing the pump chassis subsystem, capable of supporting up to two tonnes of concrete and machinery when in use, whilst also being legislation-compliant with road and construction regulations. Inventor Nastran was used to assess the structural integrity of key subsystem features such as rivets and joints, and Granta Edupack to assist in material selection.

                                As the group business manager, I oversaw that the group's technical solution was developed with a high level of commercial awareness. In addition to leading quantitative market research, I also organised and led a series of telephone-interviews with industry professionals involved with different stages of concrete pouring. This proved invaluable to informing on the commercial viability of the final technical design.

                                Developed and verified a MATLAB-based finite element model to simulate the transient diffusion-reaction-source equation. This included designing a modular code architecture that incorporated 1D-mesh generation, boundary condition handling, matrix assembly, and flexible time-stepping schemes.
                                
                            </p>

                                Model validation was handled via unit-testing, comparing model sub-assembly and full-assembly outputs to analytical solutions for multiple test-cases. Model performance was assessed using L2-norm analysis, optimising mesh resolution and timestep selection to balance computational cost with accuracy.

                                This base model was extended to simulate heat transfer in biological tissue, incorporating separate meshes to represent layered skin structures. Simulations were run to predict time and temperature thresholds for second-and third-degree burns, implementing binary and exponential search algorithms to determine burn times.
