        Hi! If you're reading this, I suspect that you must have arrived from my LinkedIn or from my CV. If so, hello!! 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This website is a personal project that I'm undertaking to learn some web development skills. I'm doing so with the help of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/" target = "_blank"  rel = "noopener">The Odin Project</a>, an open-source resource that teachers beginners a some rudimentary full-stack skills.This includes an intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then follows into either RoR or .node frameworks -- I haven't quite decided which of these I'll adopt, but I'll think about it when I get there!!

        I intend to use this website for a couple things, but mostly as a bit of a diary where I can rest easy knowing that I don't have to rely on any third-party services. I'm currently hosting this via GitHub, which you can view <a href = "https://github.com/skw43/portfolio-blog" target = "_blank"  rel = "noopener">here</a>!
