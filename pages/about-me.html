    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
        I started this website because I've always wanted to have a blog of some sort, but felt that there was just a bit too many options out there! I dabbled around with WordPress, Medium and Substack, but ultimately, I don't have an interest in monetising anything I write in the near future. I decided in the en that it might make for a good excuse to pick up a new skill, which is Web Dev! This Website is currently written in pure HTML, but in the near future I hope to add to it with CSS and have some back-end practice using JavaScript! That's all for now.

        Here is a picture of something to prove that I know how to put an image!
